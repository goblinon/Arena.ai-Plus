# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** December 2025

The **Arena.ai Plus** Chrome Extension ("the Extension") preserves your privacy.

## Data Collection
**We do not collect, store, share, or sell your personal data.** 

The Extension operates locally on your device. It fetches publicly available pricing models and configuration data from:
- `openrouter.ai`
- `helicone.ai`
- `githubusercontent.com` (for static configuration)

These requests are standard HTTPS web requests and do not transmit your personal browsing history or identity to us.

## User Preferences
Your settings (such as token unit preference or selected data provider) are stored locally in your browser's sync storage (`chrome.storage.sync`) solely to persist your preferences across sessions. We do not have access to this data.

## Contact
If you have questions about this policy, please open an issue on our project repository.
